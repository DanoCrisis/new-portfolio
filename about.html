    <h3>Hi my name is Daniel Green, and I'm a software developer. </h3><br>

    <div id="me-image-text">
        <img id="me-image" src=".\Images\me_on_fence.jpg" alt = "A picture of me sat on a fence.">
        <div>
            <p>As you can see from my picture I have always enjoyed getting out into nature on long hikes. <br>
            <br>
            This is why I got into my previous job as a dog walker.</p><br>
            
            <p>However when lockdown hit and I was stuck inside; I turned to my other main hobby, which is gaming.<br>
            <br>
            No longer was I just satisfied with playing games however, now I wanted to turn my hand at creating them. </p><br>

            <p>So I downloaded Unreal Engine 4 and got to work following along in some online tutorials for the blueprint visual scripting system<br>
            <br>
            Later when looking how to enter the job market with similar skills, I found a course with Code Nation that introduced me into back end coding in Python. </p><br>

            <p>I was immediately hooked and I continued to expand my skills in Python with tools like Pygame, creating further game and apps.<br>
            <br>
            Now I am looking to get into an apprenticeship or on the job learning, where I can expand my skills in a professional environment. </p><br>
