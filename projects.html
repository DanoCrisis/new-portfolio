            <h3>Shadow Realm</h3>
            <p>After completing an introductory course on Python, I was eager to test out my new found skills and create a text based game with greater scope than I had previously.<br> 
            <br>
            And so Shadow Realm was born; a fantasy RPG with character creation, inventory systems, and 75 levels of differing enemy types, designed using ACCII art.<br>
            </p>
            <p>       
            <br>
            Such was the scope of this game that I planned it all out in detail before beginning the project, testing out each of the functions in a small scale before implementing it. <br>
            <br>
            Ultimately it lies unfinished, as I decided to move on to more complex systems, but building what I did of Shadow Realm taught me a lot about how different systems within Python interact.

            <h3>Minesweeper</h3>
            <p>After creating a text based game, I wanted to create something with some improved visuals. So I found an instructional video on creating the windows minesweeper game using the module pygame.<br> 
            <br>
            I followed along, and was able to replicate the instructor's version of minesweeper, including the array that allowed mines to appear in random places, and the user interface; that upon clicking the correct square, would allow the corresponding image of what was “underneath” to appear.<br>
            <br>
            The instructor however left the game in an unfinished state, although there was a timer; there was no victory condition, there was no counter for the mines you had found, and there was a bug which showed any nearby mines upon the first click.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Even though I was completely new to pygame; I built upon what I had learned and kept working on the project. I added a mine counter, four levels of difficulty (each with a different number of squares and mines), improved the visuals, and added a victory condition which was met when you had correctly marked out all of the mines on the level. <br>
            <br>
            I also built on the mine marking right click function, and added a secondary click that mark a square as a “question mark” rather than a mine, which you could not accidentally click without first removing the mark. <br>
            <br>
            This project really showcased how I can pick up new skills quickly, look at problems that are still to be overcome and find creative solutions in order to solve them.

            <h3>Drum Beat App</h3>
            <p>Not wanting to focus entirely on games and also wanting to bring some sound into my projects; a beat maker app seemed like the next logical step.<br> 
            <br>
            Again I watched a video and coded along with an instructor, so most of what you see is not my original code.<br>
            </p>
            <p>       
            <br>
            However I learned lots of new skills by completing this project, including saving and loading data to an outside file, creating a none static image and of course introducing some sounds to the program. <br>
